* A basic and easy-to-understand e-commerce web application using the famous MERN Stack.
* I've also integrated Stripe Payment Gateway for Payment checkout facility.
* I'll keep adding features and updating the current features.

## Project Setup

* git clone this repo

* Ensure both servers are up and running by visiting their existing endpoints in your browser
